"""Parsing and serialization helpers for ``env = NAME,value`` entries.

Hyprland's ``env`` keyword exports environment variables to processes
spawned by the compositor (``exec``/``exec-once`` children, dispatcher
``exec`` calls, anything launched from a bind). Lines look like::

    env = XCURSOR_THEME,Bibata-Modern-Ice
    env = GDK_BACKEND,wayland,x11
    env = QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME,qt5ct

The first comma separates *name* from *value*; further commas inside
the value are preserved verbatim (the second example above is one
``GDK_BACKEND`` value, not three). Hyprland reads ``env`` lines once
at compositor startup — they **cannot be retroactively applied** to
already-spawned processes via ``hyprctl keyword``, so this page (like
autostart) lands edits in ``hyprland-gui.conf`` and takes effect on
the next Hyprland session, not live.

The ``XCURSOR_THEME`` / ``XCURSOR_SIZE`` / ``HYPRCURSOR_THEME`` /
``HYPRCURSOR_SIZE`` names are owned by the Cursor page (see
:mod:`settings.pages.cursor`) — that page reads/writes them as part of
its theme + size editor. The Env Variables page deliberately *skips*
those names on read (so the user doesn't see them duplicated in two
places) and the save path concatenates env lines from both pages,
with the Cursor page's lines first by convention.
