"""Parsing and serialization helpers for ``exec``/``exec-once`` autostart entries.

Hyprland exposes a handful of ``exec*`` keywords that all share the same
``keyword = command`` shape but differ in *when* the command runs:

============  =========================================================
``exec``      runs every time the config is reloaded
``exec-once`` runs once at Hyprland startup
============  =========================================================

(Other variants like ``execr``, ``exec-shutdown`` exist but are out of
scope for the initial autostart UI; the data model accepts arbitrary
keyword strings so they can be added later without a migration.)

These keywords can appear multiple times in a config and must be tracked
as an *ordered list* — order matters: ``exec-once`` entries are executed
sequentially, and users may rely on, e.g., ``swaybg`` finishing before
``waybar`` starts.
