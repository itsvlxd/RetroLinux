"""Hyprland window-rule structured-node adapter and Hyprlang serializer.

After ``hyprland_config.migrate()`` runs, every windowrule on disk —
single-line ``windowrule = match:class …, float on`` or block-form
``windowrule { name = X; … }`` — appears in the parsed :class:`Document`
as a structured :class:`hyprland_config.Rule` node. This module bridges
that node type and settings's UI-facing :class:`WindowRule` dataclass:

- :func:`from_rule_node` adapts one ``Rule`` into a settings
  :class:`WindowRule` (matchers → :class:`Matcher`, effects → :class:`Effect`).
- :func:`from_rule_nodes` filters / converts a Document's full Rule list,
  splitting anonymous multi-effect rules into N single-effect rules so
  the page UI's "one effect per row" model holds (named rules stay
  bundled — that's how the user authored them).
- :func:`serialize` produces the Hyprlang text per rule for the write
  path; the language-specific serializer in ``hyprland-config`` picks
  block vs. single-line based on the rule's contents.
- :func:`parse_window_rule_line` / :func:`parse_window_rule_lines` are
  thin compatibility shims that route a single Hyprlang text line
  through ``parse_string`` + ``migrate`` and return the resulting UI
  :class:`WindowRule`(s). New code should consume Rule nodes from the
  Document directly via the adapters above.
