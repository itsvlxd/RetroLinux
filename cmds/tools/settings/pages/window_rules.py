"""Window Rules page — manage ``windowrule`` / ``windowrulev2`` entries.

Hyprland's window rules let users tag specific windows for special
treatment (float, pin, set opacity, send to a workspace, …). This page
is a list editor for those rules, mirroring the autostart page's data
flow:

- One ``SavedList[WindowRule]`` is the source of truth.
- The user adds/edits/removes via :class:`WindowRuleEditDialog`, which
  takes the friction out of building a rule by offering a window picker
  ("just point at the running app"), a curated dropdown of common
  actions, and a live preview of the exact config line.
- On Apply, the new rule is pushed live to the compositor via
  ``hypr.keyword("windowrule", …)`` so users get the same
  immediate-feedback flow as the keybinds page. Rules are still
  written to settings's managed config on global save for persistence.
- The ``keyword`` push only registers the rule for *future* windows.
  Hyprland resolves windowrules to per-window state at map time —
  for both static and dynamic effects — and never re-evaluates them
  when a new rule arrives via IPC. To make "Apply Live" feel right
  we also walk the running windows, find ones the rule's matchers
  cover, and dispatch the equivalent per-window action: mutating
  dispatchers for static effects (``togglefloating address:0x…``,
  ``movetoworkspacesilent W,address:0x…``, …) and ``setprop`` for
  dynamic effects (``setprop address:0x… opacity 0.5``,
  ``setprop address:0x… no_blur on``, …). Hyprland 0.54+ keeps the
  setprop override at ``PRIORITY_SET_PROP`` until the next config
  reload, so the live preview survives window moves and resizes
  without needing the legacy ``lock`` flag.
- When the new rule's matchers would also match Retro Settings's own window
  (e.g. a wildcard ``class`` regex, or a literal class match), we gate
  the live apply behind a confirmation dialog — applying a self-targeted
  ``opacity`` or ``float`` rule while the user is editing it is jarring
  and easy to do by accident. Cancelling the dialog still commits the
  rule to the SavedList; it just doesn't push it to the compositor
  until the next save+reload.

Two limitations follow from Hyprland's IPC surface:

- There's no "remove a single windowrule" command (only a full
  ``hyprctl reload``), so deleting, reordering, or discarding a rule
  doesn't take effect on the running compositor until save (which
  rewrites the config and triggers a reload). The retroactive
  dispatch we do on Apply is also one-way: changing a rule from
  ``float`` to ``tile`` won't un-float windows that the prior rule
  already floated.
- Editing an existing rule appends the new version on top of the old
  one in the compositor's runtime list. New windows see the new rule
  win (later wins), but the stale rule is still there until reload.
  This is harmless for most effects and gets cleaned up on save.

Rules from the user's ``hyprland.conf`` (or any file it sources outside
our managed file) are surfaced read-only in a separate group at the
bottom of the list. The Binds page handles the equivalent case by
offering an "override this bind" action — that works there because
``hyprctl unbind`` cleanly removes the original. Window rules have no
such IPC, so an "override" would have to rely on Hyprland's "later
wins" resolution, which is partial (works for ``opacity`` but not
cleanly for ``no_blur`` / static effects) and pollutes the config
with counter-rules. We surface external rules with a source-file
location and tooltip so the user can edit them by hand instead.

The page deliberately limits reorder to the keyboard (Alt+↑/↓ on a
focused row) for the initial release — rule order matters in Hyprland
("later rule wins"), so reordering must be possible, but the autostart
page's full drag-and-drop path adds substantial widget plumbing that
we only need to copy over when the simpler keyboard form proves
insufficient.
