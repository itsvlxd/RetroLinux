"""Shared helpers for ``Adw.Dialog`` subclasses.

Houses :class:`SingletonDialogMixin` — a small mixin that collapses
fast double-clicks on a "show this dialog" button into a single
dialog instance. ``Adw.Dialog.present`` is asynchronous, so clicking
a trigger N times before GTK renders the first dialog would
otherwise queue N stacked dialogs.

    Use ``cls.present_singleton(parent, **kwargs)`` instead of
    ``cls(**kwargs).present(parent)``. Subsequent calls while a
    dialog of the same class is already open are silently no-ops; the
    slot is freed when the dialog emits ``closed``.

    Open dialogs are tracked in a class-keyed dict on the mixin
    itself, so each subclass gets an independent slot — an open
    ``AppPickerDialog`` won't suppress an ``AutostartEditDialog``.

    Subclasses are constructed via the same ``__init__`` keyword
    arguments passed to :meth:`present_singleton`.
