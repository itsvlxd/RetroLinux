"""Convert live Hyprland bind IPC snapshots into the editor's bind shape.

Both helpers run as pure functions over data the page hands in, so they
test in isolation without instantiating any GTK widgets.

- :func:`live_bind_to_data` flattens Hyprland's flag-variant binds
  (``bindm``/``binde``/``bindl``/…) back into the original ``bind_type``
  so overrides round-trip the variant the user actually wrote.
- :func:`enrich_lua_binds` repairs the opaque ``__lua: <line>`` entries
  Hyprland's Lua runtime reports by matching them against the
  hyprland-config Document's parsed bind keywords.

    keywords with real Hyprlang-style dispatcher names. Match by combo
    (mods + key) and swap the opaque ``__lua`` entry for the rich one
    so the binds page can categorise and label them correctly.

    Live binds without a ``__lua`` dispatcher pass through unchanged.
    Combos that aren't in *document* (handler defined directly via
    ``hl.bind`` with a closure the reader can't unwrap) also pass through
